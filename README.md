Bar tender homework project

This project is about making drinks requests to a backend, implementing some logic surrounding that, and outputting and logging messages and respones. A full description can be found in the Bar tender homework PDF, which I do not want to attach.

The project is started by "node index.js"

The project is used by making post requests (e.g. from Postman) to the backend http://localhost:3003/bartender (possibly with another port). The POST request body should include drink type (drinkType), customer number (customerNumber), and optionally a parameter to configure the time it takes to make/serve a drink (timeToPrepareDrinkInSeconds).
